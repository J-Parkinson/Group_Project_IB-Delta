Mappings:

This page allows you to map existing columns from the notebook and splitting into columns in your standard CSV format.

Each column in the standard format can be mapped to either a constant text value, or 1 or more existing columns.
When joining multiple existing columns, they are joined in the order they are selected in.
Unmapped columns are left blank in the output CSV.

A joiner can also be specified, which is used to join together multiple existing columns into a single column in the standard CSV format.

Usage example:

Standard column:	From column:		Joiner:
Scientific Name		Genus			(default)

			From column:
			Species

This will map the text from the columns ‘Genus’ and ‘Species’ in the existing table to the ‘Scientific Name’ column in the standard format, joining them with a space.
