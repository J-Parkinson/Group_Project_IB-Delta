Things to do now:

upload widget:
We have 3 preview needs:
    1. drag-n-drop
    2. file button
    3. rectangle thing
Paint the rectangles (done!)
Non-pdf warning in drag-n-drop (done!)
Add drag-n-draw (done!)
Add a fake progress bar (done by other people, but buggy)
Add a dictionary input (totally undefined??)
Connect backend
Loading page, show fun facts


Tutorial:
    - Show it first time
    - Merge things before you pass
    - Identify the number of pages per image
    - If you can't see layout, change the color scheme (Mac-only problem)

Integration:
    - Modify data structure: each column might have a dictionary

User behavior:
    -What if the user:
        Drags columns in a bad way?
        Keep adding columns?
        And many more...
