Things to do now:

upload widget:
We have 3 preview needs:
    1. drag-n-drop

    3. rectangle thing
Add a flying butterfly gif while waiting
Add a dictionary input (totally undefined??)
Connect backend (buggy)
Loading page, show fun facts (perhaps no)


Tutorial:

Integration:

        Keep adding columns?
        And many more...
