Things to do now:

upload widget:
We have 3 preview needs:
    1. drag-n-drop
    2. file button
    3. rectangle thing
Add a flying butterfly gif while waiting
Add a dictionary input (totally undefined??)
Connect backend (buggy)
Loading page, show fun facts (perhaps no)


Tutorial:
    - Show it first time (perhaps no)
    - Merge things before you pass (?)
    - Identify the number of pages per image
    - If you can't see layout, change the color scheme (Mac-only problem)
    - And, of course, a complete go through of how to use this app

Integration:
    - Modify data structure: each column might have a dictionary

User behavior:
    -What if the user:
        Drags columns in a bad way?
        Keep adding columns?
        And many more...
